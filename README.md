1. Algorithm Overview

The report discusses the implementation of a Max Heap, a binary treeâ€“based data structure designed to keep the largest element at the root. Each parent node is greater than or equal to its children, maintaining the heap property after every operation. The main operations include inserting a new element, extracting the maximum element, and increasing the value of an existing element. Each operation restores the heap order as needed to maintain correctness.

2. Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for all key operations is logarithmic because the height of the heap grows proportionally to log n. The insert, extractMax, and increaseKey operations each require O(log n) time in the average and worst cases. Building a heap from an unsorted array takes O(n) time overall. The space complexity is O(n), corresponding to the storage required for all elements. Dynamic resizing ensures that insert operations have an amortized cost of O(1).

3. Code Review and Optimization

The implementation is clearly written and well structured. Variable names are descriptive, error handling is appropriate, and performance metrics such as swaps and comparisons are correctly tracked. However, some inefficiencies were identified. The heapifyDown function performs repeated array reads that could be avoided, and the swap method reads the same elements more than once even when their values are already known. These issues could be improved for better efficiency.

4. Empirical Results

Experimental testing confirmed the theoretical complexity. Building the heap showed almost linear growth in execution time, consistent with O(n). The insert and extract operations exhibited growth close to n log n, as predicted by theory. Performance tests with increasing input sizes demonstrated stable and predictable scaling behavior that aligns with the expected asymptotic performance.

5. Conclusion

The Max Heap implementation reviewed is correct, efficient, and well-documented. Theoretical time complexity results are fully supported by experimental data. Overall, the algorithm performs as expected with O(log n) complexity for its core operations and O(n) for heap construction, validating both the design and the implementation.
